# Function should fulfill the following requirements
# {attempt to limit to approx 5 parameters}
# 1. Moments
# 2. Basic Summary Statistics [mean, median, mode, IQR]
# 3. outlier info, with ability to remove normal and extreme outliers, if desired
# 4. distribution evaluation >> kernel pdf, empirical cdf, empirical quantile function, histogram
# 5. ability to perform basic hypothesis test
